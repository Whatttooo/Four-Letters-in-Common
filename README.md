# Four-Letters-in-Common

This repository contains code for the fourLettersInCommon function that accepts a source word and a dictionary array as parameters.
The functions splits the word into chunks of four and compares these chunks with words from the dictionary array. If the chunk is a
sunstring of a word from the dictionary array, then the word shall be added to a result array.
The function returns an array of English words.

There will be multiple files for different languages. The first is Python.

Just addded the Java file! Took a while unfortunately as other work has taken a toll on my time.


C# has just been added. This may be the last installment for this repo. Figuring out how to read user input as a file path was tricky but I got there in the end!
